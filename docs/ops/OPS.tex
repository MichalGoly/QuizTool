You need to include an annotated bibliography. This should list all relevant web pages, books, journals etc. that you have consulted in researching your project. Each reference should include an annotation.

The purpose of the section is to understand what sources you are looking at.  A correctly formatted list of items and annotations is sufficient. You might go further and make use of bibliographic tools, e.g. BibTeX in a LaTeX document, could be used to provide citations, for example \cite{NumericalRecipes} \cite{MarksPaper} \cite[99-101]{FailBlog} \cite{kittenpic_ref}.  The bibliographic tools are not a requirement, but you are welcome to use them.

You can remove the above {\em Your Bibliography} section heading because it will be added in by the renewcommand which is part of the bibliography. The correct annotated bibliography information is provided below.

\nocite{*} % include everything from the bibliography, irrespective of whether it has been referenced.

% the following line is included so that the bibliography is also shown in the table of contents. There is the possibility that this is added to the previous page for the bibliography. To address this, a newline is added so that it appears on the first page for the bibliography.

% example of including an annotated bibliography. The current style is an author date one. If you want to change, comment out the line and uncomment the subsequent line. You should also modify the packages included at the top (see the notes earlier in the file) and then trash your aux files and re-run.

\renewcommand{\refname}{Annotated Bibliography}  % if you put text into the final {} on this line, you will get an extra title, e.g. References. This isn't necessary for the outline project specification.
