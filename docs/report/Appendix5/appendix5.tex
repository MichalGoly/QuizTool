\chapter{Code Examples}

For some projects, it might be relevant to include some code extracts in an appendix. You
are not expected to put all of your code here - the correct place for all of your code is in the
technical submission that is made in addition to the Final Report. However, if there are some notable
aspects of the code that you discuss, including that in an appendix might be useful to make it easier for your readers to access.

As a general guide, if you are discussing short extracts of code then you are advised to include
such code in the body of the report. If there is a longer extract that is relevant, then you
 might include it as shown in the following section.

Only include code in the appendix if that code is discussed and referred to in the body of the report.
